Cookie is set on login page now 

Next steps:
-> onload-function that checks whether cookie is set and valid (redirects to login page if cookie is not valid!)
=> important: for security reasons the cookie has to be checked before every database access by the backend, 
because the javascript could be manipulated
(this could happen sort of automatically when sending along username and password in each http request
and then using a join of the login table and the other needed table in the SQL query)

=> implement seperate login and signup page for coffe shops with same logic

=> create seperate sub pages for editing the content displayed on the overview page

Important: 
Implement a mechanism that prevents multiple users being logged in at the same time!
=> Should already be working by default probably?
