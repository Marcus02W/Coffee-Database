Next steps:

==== login logic aspects (mostly done and all important things resolved) ====

# The logic has been mostly implemented for customer_landing_page and can be implemented in the same way in the future!

    -> onload-function that checks whether cookie is set and valid (redirects to login page if cookie is not valid!)
    => important: for security reasons the cookie has to be checked before every database access by the backend, 
    because the javascript could be manipulated
    (this could happen sort of automatically when sending along username and password in each http request
    and then using a join of the login table and the other needed table in the SQL query)

# Should be working due to overwriting of cookie
    Important: 
    Implement a mechanism that prevents multiple users being logged in at the same time!
    => Should already be working by default probably?

=> logout functionality could be thought about


==== things that need to be implemented and tested ====

=> implement seperate login and signup page for coffe shops with same logic

=> implement starting page

=> complete all queries for the overview pages and test them

=> create admin page where everything can be edited in a table editor format (also good for tesing purposes to have an easy overview over whole database basically)

=> create seperate sub pages for editing the content displayed on the overview page (&displaying the whole content scrollable of course)
(only for the customer overview though -> and only for creating orders, for coffee shops you can put all on the overview page)
